## Summary of the Project

We are aiming to design a parkour situation for the agent. Given a starting point and an ending line, The goal of agent is keep going forward while jumping or moving right or left to avoid obstacles and getting as much gold and diamonds as possible. We will first using randomized function to generate random obstacles(lava, blocks etc), gold and diamonds on the map. Then, the function will choose a starting point and an ending line for the agent to reach. Our algorithm will take the position of the agent and the the structure of the map as inputs and the agent's track to the ending line as the output. By doing reinforcement learning, the output will start by being a randomized track which might encounter obstacles. Then, after training for a while, the output will be an artful track which dodged obstacles and got as much gold and diamonds as possible.
